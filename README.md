# Happy-Habits
This project aims to assist people in developing a happier life by accomplishing simple daily goals and building habits. The idea is based on the satisfaction of putting a star-sticker or check-mark on a calendar. 

One challenge that many face when trying to accomplish goals and build habits is the inconvenience of tracking the habits. The simpler we can make this process, the more likely a person will be successful. To this end, we aim to create a simple and satisfying system for tracking daily habits and goals. 

The app will present the user with a calendar which only has one functionality: placing "stickers" on each day. The initial thought is that the user will click and hold a day for a second or two, some kind of charging graphic will display, and then a sticker will apply to that day in a satisfying way. The only other functionality the user needs to worry about is adding a title to the particular calendar which describes the goal or habit being tracked. The user can save multiple calendars for different goals and easily switch between the calendars. Perhaps at certain milestones (7 days straight, one month straight, etc.), the app will congratulate the user. The app should not become more complicated than this.
